    _ SECT. 5. That in all times and nations some haue beene found who haue exceeded that number of yeares which the wisest of the ancients accounted the vtmost period of mans life, and that often those of latter ages haue exceeded the former in number of yeares, as is made to appeare as well from sacred as prophane story.

    _ SECT. 6 The same assertion farther proved and inlarged by many instances, both at home & abroad.

    _ SECT. 7. That if our liues be shortened in regard of our Ancestours, we should rather lay the burden of the fault vpon our intemperance, then vpon a decay in Nature.

    _ SECT. 1. The first reason taken from the severall stops and pawses of nature in the course of mans life, as the time of birth after our conception, our infancie, childhood, youth, mans estate, and old age, being assigned to the same compasse of yeares as they were by the Ancients; which could not possible bee, were there a vniversall decay in mankind in regard of age; And the like reason there is in making the same Clymactericall yeares and the same danger in them.

The third is borrowed from the age which the Ancients assigned for charge and imployment in publique affaires, Ecclesiasticall, Civill and Military, they were therevnto both sooner admitted, and therefrom sooner discharged then men now adayes vsually are, which should in reason argue, that they likewise vsually finished the course of their life sooner.

    _ SECT. 1. The first Reason taken from the measures of the Ancients, which were proportioned to the parts of mans bodie, and in the view of them wee are first to know that they were standards, that is, for publique contracts, certaine and constant; and consequently if the graines of our barley corne, the first principle of measure be the same with theirs, as hath already beene proved, it cannot be but our ordinary measures should bee the same with theirs, and so likewise our statures.

    _ SECT. 2. That in particular the ordinary Hebrew Graecian and Roman measures were the same with ours or very little different.

    _ SECT. 3. The second reason taken from the ordinary allowance of diet to souldiers and servants, which appeares to be of like quantity with vs, as was that among the Ancient Graecians and Romans, together with a doubt touching Gods allowance to the Israelites, answered.

    _ SEC. 5. The same farther proued, first for that the sonne often proues taller then the father. Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

    _ SECT. 1. The excellencie of the Ancients in the powers of the mind compared with those of the present, as also their helpes and hinderances in matter of learning, ballanced.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

    _ SECT. 5. That in all times and nations some haue beene found who haue exceeded that number of yeares which the wisest of the ancients accounted the vtmost period of mans life, and that often those of latter ages haue exceeded the former in number of yeares, as is made to appeare as well from sacred as prophane story.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

    _ SECT. 1.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

    _ SECT. 1.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.

    _ SECT. 1. Of sundry fabulous narrations of the bones of Gianlike bodies digged vp, or found in Caues.

Secondly, for that age and stature holding for the most part correspondence, it being already proued that the age of mankind is not decreased, from thence it followes that neither is their stature. Thirdly, for that if mankinde decreased in stature by the course of nature, so must of necessity all other creatures, they being all alike subiect to the same law of nature. Fourthly, for that if men had still declined since the Creation, by this time they would haue beene no bigger then rats or mice if they had at all beene.
